<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I am writing about the research titled <b>Cybercrime Risk in University Communities</b> that you kindly agreed to participate in. We signed most participants up during O-week.</p>
<p>You may recall the study involves the sending of fake email scams, which will attempt to entice you into revealing private information.</p>
<p>As we are due to commence the research in the coming weeks we wanted to alert you to the start of the experiments and also give an opportunity to opt out of the research.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>If you wish to withdraw from the study please contact us by email, either myself (Roderic.Broadhurst@anu.edu.au) or Nick Sifniotis nick.sifniotis@anu.edu.au.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for agreeing to be a research volunteer.</p>
<p>Professor Rod Broadhurst and the Cybercrime Observatory Team</p>
